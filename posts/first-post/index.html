<p>“POI DO TOHO” is an interactive educational video game currently in development in collaboration with ČSOB Bank, aimed at introducing players to the fundamentals of insurance. Utilizing Unity for game development and Blender for asset creation, this project merges instructive content with engaging gameplay in a user-friendly format.</p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of a 3D cityscape, the game invites players to explore various maps, each presenting a series of accident scenarios. Through simple point-and-click mechanics, players navigate their character across the city, uncovering different incidents. Upon discovering an accident, a straightforward pop-up quiz appears, prompting players to identify the correct insurance type for each case. Success in these quizzes is key to advancing to further levels, which are designed with increasing complexity and variety.</p>
<p>Incorporating elements such as moving vehicles and time-limited challenges, “POI DO TOHO” aims to provide a realistic yet safe virtual environment for learning. My role in this ongoing project is developing this game that is not only educational but also captures the interest of its young audience, aligning with ČSOB Bank’s commitment to financial literacy and practical life skills education.</p>
